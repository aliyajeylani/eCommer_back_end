# eCommerce Back End

# Description
  This week's project is to build the back end for an e-commerce site to show how we can use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database, while working in Express.js. The application will allow users to view and manipulate data using Insomnia. Based on the API route methods initiated it will return all categories, all products and all tags data from our database. We can use that information to manipulate the data, if needed. 

  Here's a demo link that demonstrates the functionality of the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fdNCu4LGTRd5yCgXtilktsphf2rxtgSR/view?usp=sharing



  ### Installation
   To complete this project, I needed to install node.js on my computer to run code in the command line. I also needed the following npm packages installed to make my application work.
   

   -Express version 4.17.1
   -dotenv version 8.2.0 (to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like MySQL username, password, and database name)
   -sequelize version 5.21.7
   -mysql2 version 3.2.0


  ### Usage

  Here is the link to my gitHub repository: https://github.com/aliyajeylani/eCommer_back_end
